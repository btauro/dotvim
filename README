You probably want to have Vim compiled with cscope (Python and Perl 
would be good to have as well). If you have access to the src, you can
rebuild Vim with these by running the config script with the --enable-cscope
etc. options and running make.

Installation:

Back up your .vim folder and your .vimrc

	mov .vimrc .vimrc.old 
	mov .vim .vim.old

Clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/khale/dotvim.git ~/.vim

Create symlink from $HOME to the vimrc in the repo

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule init && git submodule update

Keep up to date:
	
	cd ~/.vim
	git pull

---------------------------------------------------------

Upgrade a particular plugin bundle

	cd  ~/.vim/bundle/<plugin-name>
	git pull origin master

Upgrade all bundled plugins
	git submodule foreach git pull origin master
